# 🏢🤖Agency - An Idiomatic Go Interface for OpenAI API🚀

## 🎯 Overview

Agency is a Go package designed to provide an idiomatic interface to the OpenAI API. The package aims to simplify the creation and management of Language Learning Model (LLM)-based agents, making it easier for you to work with multiple agents and manage their data flow. It hopes to enable easier implementation of autonomous agent systems, inspired by systems like BabyAGI, to solve a variety of tasks.

It also provides some features one may need to deploy the code into production, like caching, retrying, or rate limiting.

At the heart of Agency is the `agent.Agent` type. This interface's three crucial methods are Listen (to communicate text to the AI), System (to send a system message), and Respond (to receive responses from the agent).

```go
client := openai.NewClient(os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
agent := agent.New("poet", agent.WithClient(client), agent.WithModel("gpt-4"))
_, err = ag.Listen("Please write a limerick about a Common Lisp programmer from Reno")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
limerick, err := ag.Respond(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Println(limerick)
```

# ❓Frequently Asked Questions

## 🔄 Why not just use LangChain🦜️🔗?

While I hold immense respect for LangChain and its impressive development speed, it does bear a few drawbacks. Primarily, LangChain's code is somewhat cryptic - it offers appealing APIs but complicates their debugging and reasoning process. I've found that deviating slightly from the original authors' intent can lead to confusion. Moreover, due to its metaprogramming usage, understanding LangChain's code becomes a daunting task. Lastly, LangChain's interface doesn't resonate with me intuitively, although this is subjective.

## 🐍Why choose Go over Python?
Despite Python being the default choice for AI work, it is not without its issues. Writing high-performance concurrent code in Python is notoriously challenging. Additionally, dependency management is complicated, and AI libraries are usually demanding and tricky to install. As much AI work nowadays consists of calling APIs like OpenAI's, it has opened doors to using other languages. Hence, my preference for Go led to the creation of Agency.

## 🏗️How production-ready is Agency?
Currently, Agency is in its early development stage and not quite ready for production use. The APIs may undergo changes without prior notification. However, due to interest from some of my friends, I decided to make this a public repository for anyone keen on exploring its potential.

## Installation
Install Agency with the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/ryszard/agency
```
# 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for Agency is available on GoDoc. The GoDoc page provides a detailed overview of the package, including its functions, types, and methods, along with their usage examples.

The GoDoc documentation should provide you with sufficient information to get started with Agency. If you have further questions, feel free to create an issue on this GitHub repository.

Remember to always keep your `OPENAI_API_KEY` secure and to adhere to the OpenAI use case policy when using the OpenAI API. *This line was ChatGPT's idea. I decided to humor it.*

## 👨‍💻Usage
Here's a full working example of how you can use Agency to create two agents, a poet and a critic, that interact with each other to create better content.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/ryszard/agency/agent"
	"github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai"
	log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
	log.SetLevel(log.ErrorLevel)
	client := openai.NewClient(os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

	// Initialize a poet agent and a critic agent
	poet := agent.New("poet",
		agent.WithClient(client),
		agent.WithModel(openai.GPT3Dot5Turbo),
		agent.WithMaxTokens(2000),
		agent.WithTemperature(0.7))

	critic := agent.New("critic",
		agent.WithClient(client),
		agent.WithModel(openai.GPT3Dot5Turbo),
		agent.WithMaxTokens(2000))

	// Set the topic for the haiku
	topic := "sunrise"

	// The poet writes a haiku about the given topic
	_, err := poet.Listen(fmt.Sprintf("Write a haiku about a %s", topic))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Poet Listen failed: %v", err)
	}

	haiku, err := poet.Respond(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Poet Respond failed: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Haiku:\n%s\n", haiku)

	// The critic critiques the haiku
	_, err = critic.Listen(fmt.Sprintf("Please critique this haiku: \n%s", haiku))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Critic Listen failed: %v", err)
	}

	critique, err := critic.Respond(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Critic Respond failed: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Critique: %s\n", critique)

	// Create a loop for the poet to improve and the critic to critique
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		// Poet takes into account the critique and tries to improve
		_, err = poet.Listen(fmt.Sprintf("Feedback received: '%s'. Please improve the haiku.", critique))
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Poet Listen failed: %v", err)
		}

		haiku, err = poet.Respond(context.Background())
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Poet Respond failed: %v", err)
		}

		// The critic critiques the improved haiku
		_, err = critic.Listen(fmt.Sprintf("Please critique this improved haiku: \n%s", haiku))
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Critic Listen failed: %v", err)
		}

		critique, err = critic.Respond(context.Background())
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Critic Respond failed: %v", err)
		}

		fmt.Printf("Improved Haiku: %s\nCritique: %s\n", haiku, critique)
	}
}

```

In this example, the poet writes a haiku about a given topic, and the critic provides feedback on the poem. Then, in a loop, the poet attempts to improve the poem based on the critic's feedback, and the critic provides another round of critique. This iterative improvement and critique process continues for a set number of iterations.
